Data Science & AI,Capstone,1,Plagiarism Detector,Case Study,"A case study is an opportunity to reflect on important issues at the intersection of computer science and other fields of study. Students will read about a complex topic, form their own opinion, and build a Python program that incorporates what you learned. Finally, students will develop a response that demonstrates their latest thinking on the topic and how it was reflected in their project. The focus of this case study is on plagiarism and the tools used to detect it. Plagiarism means taking someone else's words or ideas and presenting them as your own. It's considered a form of academic dishonesty, a.k.a. cheating. Many high schools and colleges use online plagiarism detection tools, which scan student essays and look for text from other sources.","Students will:
